# Augment Backend - Known Issues

**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025  
**Testing Status:** ❌ Not production-ready - backend issues  
**Recommendation:** Use Jules or OpenHands instead

---

## 📊 Quick Summary

| Issue | Status | Root Cause | Fixable? |
|-------|--------|------------|----------|
| #1: JavaScript Runtime Error | 🔴 Critical | Augment backend bug | ❌ Requires Augment team |
| #2: Backend API Timeout | 🔴 Critical | Server-side 10min limit | ❌ Requires Augment team |

**Bottom Line:** Both critical issues are in Augment's backend. We've fixed all orchestrator-side issues.

**Test Results:** 100% failure rate (4/4 runs failed due to backend errors)

## 🚨 Critical Issues

### Issue #1: JavaScript Runtime Error in Augment Backend

**Severity:** 🔴 Critical  
**Status:** Unresolved (Augment backend issue)  
**First Observed:** October 15, 2025

#### Error Message
```
❌ Agent execution failed: e.split is not a function
```

#### Details
- **What happens:** Augment CLI completes with exit code 1 after ~10 minutes
- **Root cause:** Internal JavaScript error in Augment's backend code
- **Impact:** Planning fails even though Augment created files successfully
- **Workaround:** None - this is a bug in Augment's cloud service

#### Evidence
```
2025-10-15 21:58:44,836 - Planning experiment started
2025-10-15 22:09:13,565 - Auggie command completed with exit code 1
❌ Agent execution failed: e.split is not a function
```

#### Technical Analysis
The error `e.split is not a function` suggests:
- Augment's backend expected a string variable `e`
- `e` was actually `undefined`, `null`, or an object
- JavaScript threw a TypeError when trying to call `.split()`

This is a **server-side bug** in Augment's codebase, not a client-side issue.

### Issue #2: Backend API Timeout (Previous Runs)

**Severity:** 🔴 Critical  
**Status:** Unresolved (Augment backend limitation)  
**First Observed:** October 15, 2025

#### Error Message
```
❌ API Error: "unavailable: The operation was aborted due to timeout"
```

#### Details
- **What happens:** Augment's API backend times out after ~9-10 minutes
- **Root cause:** Server-side timeout in Augment's infrastructure
- **Impact:** Long-running tasks fail mid-execution
- **Client timeout:** Set to 5 hours (18,000 seconds) - not the issue
- **Server timeout:** Appears to be ~10 minutes (cannot be changed client-side)

#### Evidence
```
2025-10-15 21:34:22,645 - Planning started
2025-10-15 21:43:46,152 - Completed with exit code 1
Time elapsed: 9 minutes 24 seconds
API Error: "unavailable: The operation was aborted due to timeout"
```

#### Attempted Fixes
- ✅ Increased client-side timeout to 5 hours → No effect
- ❌ Cannot control Augment's server-side timeout

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis

### Why Augment Fails But Jules/OpenHands Succeed

**Architecture Differences:**

#### Jules/OpenHands:
```
Orchestrator → API → Backend (Stable, handles long tasks)
                 ↓
            Auto-commits work
                 ↓
            Returns when complete
```

#### Augment:
```
Orchestrator → CLI → API → Backend (Unstable, ~10min timeout)
                              ↓
                        Internal JS errors
                              ↓
                        Backend crashes/timeouts
                              ↓
                        Returns error to client
```

**Key Problems:**
1. **Extra layer:** CLI → API adds complexity and failure points
2. **No resilience:** Backend crashes on internal errors instead of handling them gracefully
3. **Short timeout:** ~10 minute server-side limit (insufficient for complex tasks)

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Users
- ❌ **Do NOT use Augment** for production experiments
- ✅ **Use Jules or OpenHands instead** - both tested and working reliably
- ⏳ **Wait for Augment team** to fix backend issues before using

### For Augment Team (Critical Fixes Needed)

**Priority 1: Fix JavaScript Error**
```
Error: e.split is not a function
Location: Backend code (server-side)
Impact: 100% failure rate
Action: Debug backend code to handle undefined/null values
```

**Priority 2: Increase Backend Timeout**
```
Current: ~10 minutes
Needed: At least 30-60 minutes for complex tasks
Impact: All long-running tasks fail
Action: Increase server-side timeout limits
```

**Priority 3: Better Error Handling**
- Return actionable error messages (not just "unavailable")
- Include stack traces for debugging
- Add retry mechanisms for transient failures

**Priority 4: Stability Improvements**
- Add input validation to prevent JS errors
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Test edge cases more thoroughly
