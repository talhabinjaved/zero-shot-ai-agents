Sentiment Analysis Showdown,False,"Build and compare 3 different sentiment analysis approaches on movie reviews: (1) Traditional ML with TF-IDF + Logistic Regression (baseline), (2) Pre-trained BERT embeddings + Linear classifier, (3) Fine-tuned distilBERT. Use IMDB movie review dataset (subset of 5000 reviews for speed). Compare accuracy, F1-score, inference time, and model size. Analyze which approach works best for different review lengths and sentiment intensities. Generate confusion matrices, ROC curves, and error analysis showing which types of reviews each model struggles with.",
